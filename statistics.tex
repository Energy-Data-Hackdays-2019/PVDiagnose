\section*{Testing for Malfunction}

Let $X_t$ be the monthly produced energy and $\mu_t$ is the value estimated by sonnendach.ch for each month.
We assume that $X_t$ is normally distributed with variance $\sigma^2$ not depending on $t$. 
We model the expectation of $X_t$ as the sum of a systematic part $\gamma$ and the temporal part $\mu_t$, concretely

\[ X_t \sim N( \mu_t + \gamma, \sigma^2). \]

Thus we have for $Z_t := X_t - \mu_t$

\[ Z_t \sim N( \gamma, \sigma^2 ) \]
 
and we assume that the $Z_t$ are independent.
This can now be used to construct a statistical test at level $\alpha$, here $\alpha=0.05$. Let $\gamma_0$ be a real number, in practice $\gamma_0$ will be zero.
We test the following hypothesis:
\begin{align*}
      H_0: \qquad \gamma & \ge \gamma_0  \\
      H_1: \qquad \gamma & < \gamma_0 
\end{align*}

If the hypothesis $H_0$ is rejected, the systematic difference $\gamma$ is below the level where it is assumed to be working, thus indicating a malfunction. For testing we use the following statistic

\[ P = \sqrt{n} \frac{\overline{Z}-\gamma_0}{S_n} \]

where $n$ is the number of months, $\overline{Z}$ is the mean of the $Z_t$ and $S_n^2$ is its unbiased sample variance.
Note that $P$ is t-distributed of degree $n-1$. Therefore, we consider the PV as malfunctioning if

\[ P < t_{n-1}^{-1}(\alpha) \]

with $t_{n-1}^{-1}$ the quantile function of the t-distribution.
